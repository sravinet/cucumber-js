# Cucumber Workers - Phase 2 Implementation Plan

## Overview

Phase 2 of the Cucumber Workers project focuses on achieving feature parity with Cucumber.js and refining the API to provide a more complete BDD testing experience in the Cloudflare Workers environment. This phase will build upon the core architecture established in Phase 1, implementing essential Cucumber.js features while optimizing for the constraints of the Workers platform.

## Timeline

**Duration:** 6-8 weeks
**Start Date:** April 2023
**End Date:** June 2023

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Enhanced API (Weeks 1-2)

#### 1.1 Tags Support
- Implement tag expression parsing using `@cucumber/tag-expressions`
- Add tag filtering to test execution
- Support for tag-based test selection in the Vitest integration
- Example usage:
  ```typescript
  createCucumberTest(test, {
    name: 'Calculator features',
    features: [calculatorFeature],
    tagExpression: '@smoke and not @slow'
  });
  ```

#### 1.2 Hooks Implementation
- Add support for Before, After, BeforeAll, and AfterAll hooks
- Implement hook execution order and tagging
- Support for hook timeouts and error handling
- Example usage:
  ```typescript
  import { Before, After } from '@cucumber/cucumber-workers';
  
  Before(function() {
    // Setup code before each scenario
  });
  
  Before({ tags: '@database' }, function() {
    // Setup code for scenarios with @database tag
  });
  
  After(function() {
    // Teardown code after each scenario
  });
  ```

#### 1.3 Data Tables
- Implement DataTable class compatible with Cucumber.js
- Support for table transformations (raw, hashes, rows, etc.)
- Example usage:
  ```typescript
  Given('the following users exist:', function(dataTable) {
    const users = dataTable.hashes();
    // Process users data
  });
  ```

#### 1.4 Scenario Outlines and Examples
- Support for scenario outlines with examples tables
- Parameter substitution in steps
- Example usage in feature files:
  ```gherkin
  Scenario Outline: Adding different numbers
    Given I have <a> and <b>
    When I add them
    Then I should get <result>
    
    Examples:
      | a | b | result |
      | 1 | 2 | 3      |
      | 5 | 7 | 12     |
  ```

### 2. Multiple Formatters (Weeks 3-4)

#### 2.1 JSON Formatter
- Implement a JSON formatter compatible with Cucumber.js JSON output
- Support for detailed test results in JSON format
- Integration with Vitest reporting

#### 2.2 Progress Formatter
- Implement a progress formatter showing test execution progress
- Support for colorized output in compatible environments
- Minimal output mode for CI environments

#### 2.3 Summary Formatter
- Implement a summary formatter showing test run statistics
- Support for duration, counts of passed/failed/skipped tests
- Integration with Vitest summary reporting

#### 2.4 Formatter Configuration
- Support for configuring formatters through options
- Allow multiple formatters to be used simultaneously
- Example usage:
  ```typescript
  createCucumberTest(test, {
    name: 'Calculator features',
    features: [calculatorFeature],
    formatters: [
      { type: 'progress' },
      { type: 'json', outputFile: 'cucumber-report.json' }
    ]
  });
  ```

### 3. Error Handling (Weeks 4-5)

#### 3.1 Source Mapping
- Implement source mapping for error stack traces
- Map error locations back to feature files
- Improve error reporting in the Workers environment

#### 3.2 Error Formatting
- Enhance error messages with context information
- Show feature file snippets around error locations
- Colorize error output for better readability

#### 3.3 Assertion Library Integration
- Support for common assertion libraries
- Custom error formatting for assertion failures
- Example usage:
  ```typescript
  Then('I should get {int}', function(expected) {
    expect(this.result).to.equal(expected);
  });
  ```

### 4. Documentation (Weeks 5-6)

#### 4.1 API Documentation
