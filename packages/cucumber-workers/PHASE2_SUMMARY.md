- Implemented a summary formatter showing test run statistics
- Added support for duration, counts of passed/failed/skipped tests
- Integrated with Vitest summary reporting

#### 2.4 Formatter Configuration
- Added support for configuring formatters through options
- Implemented the ability to use multiple formatters simultaneously

### 3. Error Handling

We have enhanced error handling with:

#### 3.1 Source Mapping
- Implemented source mapping for error stack traces
- Added mapping of error locations back to feature files
- Improved error reporting in the Workers environment

#### 3.2 Error Formatting
- Enhanced error messages with context information
- Added feature file snippets around error locations
- Implemented colorized error output for better readability

### 4. Documentation

We have created comprehensive documentation:

#### 4.1 API Documentation
- Created comprehensive API documentation in `docs/api-reference.md`
- Documented all public APIs with TypeScript types
- Added examples for all API functions

#### 4.2 Usage Examples
- Created examples for common use cases in `docs/usage-examples.md`
- Documented integration with Vitest and Vite
- Provided examples for different testing scenarios

#### 4.3 Migration Guide
- Created a guide for migrating from Cucumber.js to Cucumber Workers in `docs/migration-guide.md`
- Documented differences and limitations
- Provided workarounds for unsupported features

### 5. Performance Optimizations

We have implemented the following performance optimizations:

#### 5.1 Memory Optimizations
- Optimized memory usage for Workers environment in `utils/memory-optimizations.ts`
- Implemented memory-efficient data structures
- Reduced memory footprint during test execution

#### 5.2 Execution Time Optimizations
- Optimized test execution time in `utils/execution-optimizations.ts`
- Implemented parallel test execution where possible
- Reduced startup time for test runs

#### 5.3 Build-time Optimizations
- Optimized feature file processing during build
- Enhanced the Vite plugin for better performance
- Reduced build time for large test suites

## API Implementation

We've implemented a familiar Cucumber.js-like API with the following enhancements:

```typescript
// Step definition functions
Given(pattern, fn)
When(pattern, fn)
Then(pattern, fn)

// Hook functions
Before(options?, fn)
After(options?, fn)
BeforeAll(options?, fn)
AfterAll(options?, fn)

// Custom parameter types
defineParameterType({ name, regexp, transformer })

// Test creation
createCucumberTest(testFn, options)
```

## Performance Improvements

### Memory Optimizations

- Implemented lazy iterables for large data sets
- Created memory-efficient caches with LRU eviction
- Added string builder optimizations for formatters
- Implemented batch processing to reduce memory pressure
- Created object pools for reusing objects
- Optimized arrays using typed arrays where possible

### Execution Time Optimizations

- Implemented parallel execution with concurrency limits
- Added memoization for expensive operations
- Created utilities for running tasks with timeouts
- Implemented priority-based task execution
- Added chunked processing to avoid blocking the event loop
- Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff

## Next Steps for Phase 3

1. **Vite Integration**: Enhance the Vite plugin to provide a seamless development experience
2. **HMR Support**: Implement hot module replacement for feature files and step definitions
3. **Development Workflow**: Create a standardized workflow for developing, building, and running tests
4. **Environment Configuration**: Add support for different test environments through Vite's configuration
5. **Example Projects**: Create sample projects demonstrating different use cases with Vite integration

## Conclusion

Phase 2 has successfully achieved feature parity with Cucumber.js while optimizing for the Workers environment. The implementation provides a robust foundation for BDD testing in Cloudflare Workers, with comprehensive documentation and examples to help users get started. The performance optimizations ensure that tests run efficiently within the constraints of the Workers platform, and the enhanced API provides a familiar experience for users coming from Cucumber.js.
