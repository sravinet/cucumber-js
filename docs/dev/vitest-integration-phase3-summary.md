  - Fixed property naming inconsistencies (`import` vs `importPaths`)
  - Ensured consistent structure in all test configurations
  - Verified proper support code library caching with corrected configurations

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Support Code Caching

The support code caching mechanism significantly improves performance by avoiding the need to reload and recompile step definitions for each test run. This is particularly beneficial in larger projects with many step definitions.

```typescript
// Cache for support code libraries to avoid reloading step definitions
const supportCodeCache = new Map<string, ISupportCodeLibrary>()

function generateCacheKey(options: IVitestRunOptions): string {
  // Generate a unique key based on support code coordinates
  // ...
}

// In runCucumberInVitest:
if (!options.runtime?.dryRun && !('originalCoordinates' in options.support)) {
  const cacheKey = generateCacheKey(options)
  const cachedSupport = supportCodeCache.get(cacheKey)
  
  if (cachedSupport) {
    // Use the cached support code library
    options = {
      ...options,
      support: cachedSupport
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Reporting

The enhanced error reporting provides detailed information about failed scenarios, making it easier to identify and fix issues:

```typescript
function extractScenarioInfo(messages: Envelope[]): {
  // Extract detailed scenario information from Cucumber messages
  // ...
}

// In createVitestCucumberTest:
if (!result.success) {
  const failedScenarios = scenarioInfo.scenarios
    .filter(s => s.status === 'failed')
    .map(s => `  - ${s.name} (${s.uri}:${s.line})${s.error ? '\n    ' + s.error.message : ''}`)
    .join('\n')
  
  throw new Error(`Cucumber tests failed:\n${failedScenarios}`)
}
```

### 3. Step Definition Organization

The improved step definition organization prevents ambiguity and makes tests more maintainable:

```javascript
// Single consolidated step definition file (counter_steps.js)
import { Given, When, Then } from '@cucumber/cucumber/esm'
import { expect } from 'vitest'

Given('the counter is at {int}', function(value) {
  this.setCounter(value)
})

When('I increment the counter', function() {
  this.incrementCounter()
})

When('I decrement the counter', function() {
  this.decrementCounter()
})

When('I reset the counter', function() {
  this.resetCounter()
})

Then('the counter should be {int}', function(expected) {
  const actual = this.getCounterValue()
  expect(actual).toBe(expected)
})
```

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy for the Vitest adapter includes:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual functions and components of the adapter
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing the adapter's integration with Cucumber and Vitest
3. **Example Tests**: Providing real-world examples that also serve as tests
4. **Tag-Based Testing**: Demonstrating how to use tags for selective test execution

The tests ensure that:

- The adapter correctly runs Cucumber features in Vitest's environment
- Hooks are called at the appropriate times
- Error handling works as expected
- Support code caching improves performance
- The adapter provides detailed error reporting
- Step definition ambiguity is properly handled
- Tag-based filtering works correctly

## Next Steps

While Phase 3 has successfully completed the planned tasks, there are some potential future enhancements:

1. **Further Performance Optimization**: Continue to optimize performance for very large test suites
2. **Enhanced Reporting**: Add more advanced reporting options, such as HTML reports or integration with Vitest's UI
3. **Parallel Execution**: Improve support for parallel execution of Cucumber scenarios
4. **TypeScript Enhancements**: Enhance TypeScript type definitions for better developer experience
5. **Step Definition Management**: Develop better tools or guidelines for managing step definitions in large projects

## Conclusion

Phase 3 of the Vitest integration plan has been successfully completed. The Vitest adapter now provides a robust, performant, and user-friendly way to run Cucumber.js features in Vitest's environment. The comprehensive testing, performance optimizations, enhanced reporting, and improved documentation ensure that users can effectively integrate Cucumber.js with Vitest in their projects.

The two-tiered API design (high-level `createVitestCucumberTest` helper and low-level `runCucumberInVitest` function) provides flexibility for different use cases, while the support code caching mechanism ensures good performance even with large test suites. The detailed error reporting makes it easier to identify and fix issues, and the comprehensive documentation helps users get started quickly and follow best practices.

The resolution of step definition ambiguity issues and the implementation of tag-based scenario selection further enhance the usability and reliability of the Vitest adapter, making it a solid choice for running Cucumber.js features in a modern JavaScript testing environment.
