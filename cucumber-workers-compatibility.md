# Making Cucumber.js Compatible with Cloudflare Workers

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a specialized version of Cucumber.js that is fully compatible with Cloudflare Workers, leveraging both `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` for test execution and `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` for development workflow. The goal is to enable developers to write and run Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) tests directly in the Workers environment, maintaining the familiar Gherkin syntax while working within the constraints of the Workers platform.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Core Architecture and Proof of Concept

**Duration: 4-6 weeks**

#### Objectives:
- Create a minimal viable implementation of Cucumber.js that runs in Workers
- Develop core components for feature file loading and step definition registration
- Establish integration with vitest-pool-workers
- Demonstrate a simple end-to-end test case

#### Key Deliverables:
1. **Feature File Loader**: A system to load feature files in the Workers environment
2. **Step Definition Registry**: A mechanism to register and execute step definitions
3. **Workers Runtime Adapter**: Integration with vitest-pool-workers
4. **Basic Formatter**: A simple formatter for test results
5. **Proof of Concept**: A working example with a simple feature file and step definitions

#### Technical Approach:

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **Feature File Loader**
   ```typescript
   class WorkersFeatureLoader {
     private features = new Map<string, string>();
     
     register(path: string, content: string): void {
       this.features.set(path, content);
     }
     
     async load(path: string): Promise<string> {
       return this.features.get(path);
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Step Definition Registry**
   ```typescript
   class WorkersStepRegistry {
     private definitions = [];
     
     register(pattern: RegExp | string, fn: Function): void {
       this.definitions.push({ pattern, fn });
     }
     
     getDefinitions(): any[] {
       return this.definitions;
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Workers Runtime Adapter**
   ```typescript
   async function runCucumberInWorkers(options, workerRuntime) {
     const environment = {
       cwd: '/',
       stdout: workerRuntime.console.stdout,
       stderr: workerRuntime.console.stderr,
       env: workerRuntime.env,
     };
     
     return await runCucumberInVitest(options, environment);
   }
   ```

4. **Vite Plugin for Cucumber Workers**
   ```typescript
   // vite-plugin-cucumber-workers.ts
   import { Plugin } from 'vite';
   
   export function cucumberWorkers(options = {}): Plugin {
     return {
       name: 'vite-plugin-cucumber-workers',
       
       // Transform feature files into importable modules
       transform(code, id) {
         if (id.endsWith('.feature')) {
           return {
             code: `export default ${JSON.stringify(code)};`,
             map: null
           };
         }
       },
       
       // Configure Vite for Cucumber Workers
       configureServer(server) {
         // Set up HMR for feature files and step definitions
       },
       
       // Build hooks for processing feature files
       buildStart() {
         // Initialize feature file processing
       },
       
       // Generate feature file manifest
       generateBundle() {
         // Generate a manifest of all feature files
       }
     };
   }
   ```

### Usage Example with Vite Integration

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import { cloudflare } from '@cloudflare/vite-plugin';
import { cucumberWorkers } from '@cucumber/cucumber-workers/vite';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    cloudflare(),
    cucumberWorkers({
      featureGlob: 'features/**/*.feature',
      stepDefinitionsGlob: 'features/step_definitions/**/*.ts'
    })
  ],
  test: {
    environment: 'node',
    pool: '@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers',
    poolOptions: {
      workers: {
        // Workers-specific configuration
      }
    }
  }
});
```

```typescript
// cucumber.worker.test.ts
import { test } from 'vitest';
import { createCucumberTest } from '@cucumber/cucumber-workers';
import { Given, When, Then } from '@cucumber/cucumber-workers/step-registry';

// Import feature file (transformed by the Vite plugin)
import calculatorFeature from '../features/calculator.feature';

// Define step definitions
Given('I have {int} and {int}', function(a, b) {
  this.a = a;
  this.b = b;
});

When('I add them', function() {
  this.result = this.a + this.b;
});

Then('I should get {int}', function(expected) {
  if (this.result !== expected) {
    throw new Error(`Expected ${expected} but got ${this.result}`);
  }
});

// Create a Cucumber test
createCucumberTest(test, {
  name: 'Calculator features',
  features: [calculatorFeature],
});
```

### Development Workflow

```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "test": "vitest run",
    "test:watch": "vitest"
  }
}
```

This workflow allows developers to:
- Run `npm run dev` for interactive test development with HMR
- Run `npm run build` to build the test suite
- Run `npm run preview` to validate the built tests
- Run `npm run test` to execute the test suite
- Run `npm run test:watch` for watch mode during development

### Environment Configuration

```
# .env.test
CLOUDFLARE_ENV=test

# .env.staging
CLOUDFLARE_ENV=staging
```

This allows running tests against different environments:

```bash
# Run tests in the test environment
vite build --mode test

# Run tests in the staging environment
vite build --mode staging
```

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: File System Access
**Challenge**: Workers cannot access the file system directly.  
**Solution**: Process feature files during build time using Vite's transformation capabilities.

### Challenge 2: Dynamic Module Loading
**Challenge**: Workers cannot dynamically load modules.  
**Solution**: Create a static registration system for step definitions and use Vite's bundling to include all necessary code.

### Challenge 3: Memory and Execution Time Limits
**Challenge**: Workers have strict memory and execution time limits.  
**Solution**: Optimize the implementation for minimal memory usage and fast execution.

### Challenge 4: Node.js-specific APIs
**Challenge**: Cucumber.js uses Node.js-specific APIs.  
**Solution**: Replace Node.js-specific code with browser-compatible alternatives.

### Challenge 5: Development Experience
**Challenge**: Providing a seamless development experience for BDD testing.  
**Solution**: Leverage Vite's HMR capabilities and the Cloudflare Vite plugin for a fast, iterative development workflow.

## Conclusion

By leveraging the `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` alongside `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`, we can create a more integrated and developer-friendly solution for running Cucumber.js tests in Cloudflare Workers. The implementation plan focuses on creating a seamless development experience while maintaining the core functionality needed for BDD testing in the Workers environment.

The Vite integration will provide significant benefits in terms of development workflow, hot module replacement, and build optimization, making it easier for developers to adopt and use our solution. This approach aligns with Cloudflare's recommended development practices and will result in a more maintainable and future-proof solution.
