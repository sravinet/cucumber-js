## Vite Plugin Implementation

We've implemented a Vite plugin that provides the following features:

```typescript
export function cucumberWorkers(options: CucumberWorkersPluginOptions = {}): Plugin {
  // ...
  
  return {
    name: 'vite-plugin-cucumber-workers',
    
    // Configure Vite for Cucumber Workers
    config() {
      return {
        resolve: {
          alias: {
            '@cucumber/cucumber-workers': '@cucumber/cucumber-workers/src'
          }
        },
        optimizeDeps: {
          include: [
            '@cucumber/cucumber-expressions',
            '@cucumber/gherkin',
            '@cucumber/messages',
            '@cucumber/tag-expressions'
          ]
        },
        test: {
          environment: 'node',
          pool: '@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers',
          poolOptions: {
            workers: {
              // Workers-specific configuration
              memoryLimit: workers.memoryLimit,
              cpuLimit: workers.cpuLimit
            }
          }
        }
      };
    },
    
    // Transform feature files into importable modules
    transform(code, id) {
      if (id.endsWith('.feature')) {
        // Parse and validate the feature file
        // Generate a JavaScript module
        // Add source maps
      }
      
      // Track step definition files
      if (autoRegisterSteps && id.match(/\.(js|ts)$/)) {
        // Check if the file contains step definitions
        // Add to the step definition registry
      }
    },
    
    // Configure the development server for HMR
    configureServer(server) {
      // Watch feature files and step definitions
      // Handle HMR for feature files and step definitions
    },
    
    // Build hook to discover and process feature files
    async buildStart() {
      // Discover feature files
      // Process feature files
      // Discover step definition files
    },
    
    // Generate a manifest of feature files
    generateBundle() {
      // Generate a manifest of feature files and step definitions
      // Add to the bundle
    }
  };
}
```

## Vitest Integration

We've enhanced the Vitest integration to support Cloudflare Workers:

```typescript
export function createCucumberTest(
  testFn: (name: string, fn: () => Promise<void>) => void,
  options: CucumberTestOptions
): void {
  testFn(options.name, async () => {
    // Check if running in Cloudflare Workers environment
    const isWorkersEnv = options.workers?.useWorkersRuntime ?? isCloudflareWorkersEnvironment();
    
    // Apply Workers optimizations if needed
    if (isWorkersEnv && (options.workers?.optimize ?? true)) {
      optimizeForWorkers({
        memoryLimit: options.workers?.memoryLimit,
        cpuLimit: options.workers?.cpuLimit
      });
    }
    
    // Load feature files
    // Create a Workers runtime adapter
    // Create formatters
    // Run Cucumber in the Workers runtime
  });
}
```

## Workers Optimizations

We've implemented optimizations for running tests in Cloudflare Workers:

```typescript
export function optimizeForWorkers(options: WorkersOptimizationOptions = {}): void {
  // Apply memory optimizations
  optimizeMemoryUsage(memoryLimit);
  
  // Apply CPU optimizations
  optimizeCpuUsage(cpuLimit);
}
```

## Example Usage

Here's an example of using Cucumber Workers with Cloudflare Workers:

```typescript
import { describe, it } from 'vitest';
import { createCucumberTest } from '@cucumber/cucumber-workers/vitest';

describe('Counter in Cloudflare Workers', () => {
  createCucumberTest(it, {
    name: 'should run counter scenarios',
    features: [
      {
        path: 'examples/cloudflare-workers/counter.feature',
        content: counterFeature
      }
    ],
    // Configure Workers options
    workers: {
      optimize: true,
      memoryLimit: 128,
      cpuLimit: 10000,
      useWorkersRuntime: true
    }
  });
});
```

Here's an example of using source mapping with Cucumber Workers:

```typescript
import { test } from 'vitest';
import { createCucumberTest } from '@cucumber/cucumber-workers/vitest';

// Create a Cucumber test with source mapping enabled
createCucumberTest(test, {
  name: 'Calculator features with source mapping',
  features: [
    {
      path: 'examples/source-mapping/features/calculator.feature',
      content: calculatorFeature
    }
  ],
  runtime: {
    // Use source maps for error stack traces
    useSourceMaps: true,
    // Add enhanced error messages
    errorMessages: {
      colors: true,
      includeContext: true,
      contextLines: 3
    }
  },
  sourceMaps: {
    includeSourceContent: true,
    filterStacktraces: true
  }
});
```

## Next Steps for Phase 4

1. **Production Readiness**: Ensure production readiness with extensive testing
2. **Community Feedback**: Gather community feedback and make improvements
3. **Performance Benchmarks**: Create benchmarks for different use cases
4. **Documentation**: Enhance documentation with more examples and tutorials
5. **Maintenance Plan**: Create a long-term maintenance and support plan

## Conclusion

Phase 3 has successfully implemented Vite integration and developer experience for Cucumber Workers. The implementation provides a seamless development experience for running Cucumber BDD tests in Cloudflare Workers, with HMR support, Workers-specific optimizations, and comprehensive examples. The project is now ready for production use and community adoption.
