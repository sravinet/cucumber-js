# Cucumber.js ESM and Vitest Integration - Phase 1 Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Enhanced ESM Support

- **Updated `wrapper.mjs`**: Added missing TypeScript interface exports to ensure complete API surface
- **Created `esm.mjs`**: Developed a comprehensive ESM entry point with all necessary exports for Vitest integration
- **Added TypeScript Declarations**: Created `esm.d.ts` with TypeScript types for the ESM entry point
- **Updated Package.json**: Added a new export path for the ESM entry point (`@cucumber/cucumber/esm`)

### 2. Documentation

- **Updated ESM Documentation**: Enhanced `docs/esm.md` with information about the new ESM entry point
- **Created Vitest Documentation**: Added `docs/vitest.md` with comprehensive documentation on Vitest integration
- **Added Examples**: Created example projects demonstrating Cucumber.js with Vitest:
  - Basic JavaScript example in `examples/vitest/`
  - Advanced TypeScript example in `examples/vitest-typescript/`

### 3. Examples

#### JavaScript Example
- Simple calculator feature with step definitions
- Custom World object
- Vitest configuration and test file

#### TypeScript Example
- Todo list feature with step definitions
- TypeScript interfaces and types
- Custom World object with TypeScript types
- Vitest configuration and test file

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. **Create Vitest Adapter**: Develop a Vitest-specific adapter for deeper integration
2. **Runtime Compatibility**: Ensure Cucumber's runtime works within Vitest's worker threads
3. **Feature and Step Definition Loading**: Enhance file discovery to work with Vitest's file system

## Testing

The examples provided demonstrate that the basic integration works, but more comprehensive testing will be needed in Phase 2 to ensure full compatibility with Vitest's environment.

## Verification

To ensure Phase 1 is complete, a comprehensive verification process has been implemented:

### Verification Scripts

1. **ESM Entry Point Verification**: Verifies that the ESM entry point is working correctly by importing and checking all exported components.
2. **Examples Verification**: Verifies that the example projects are correctly set up with all required files and content.
3. **Documentation Verification**: Verifies that the documentation has been updated with information about the ESM entry point and Vitest integration.

### Running Verification

To run all verification scripts:

```bash
npm run verify-phase1
```

Or run individual verification scripts:

```bash
npm run verify-esm
npm run verify-examples
npm run verify-docs
```

### Checklist

A comprehensive checklist has been created to ensure all aspects of Phase 1 are complete. See `verification/phase1-checklist.md` for details.

## Conclusion

Phase 1 of the Vitest integration plan has been successfully completed. The groundwork for Vitest integration is now in place, with a comprehensive ESM entry point, updated documentation, and example projects. Phase 2 will focus on creating a Vitest-specific adapter for deeper integration.
