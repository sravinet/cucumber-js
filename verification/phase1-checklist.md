## Challenges and Solutions

During the implementation of Phase 1, we encountered several challenges that required careful solutions:

### TypeScript Build Issues

**Challenge:** The TypeScript build was failing with errors related to type definitions for dependencies, particularly the `mime` package and `type-fest`.

**Solution:** 
- Updated TypeScript to version 5.8.2 to ensure compatibility with newer dependencies
- Created custom type definitions for the `mime` package (version 3.0.0) in `src/types/mime.d.ts`
- Downgraded from mime 4.0.6 (ESM-only) to mime 3.0.0 (CommonJS compatible) to avoid ESM/CommonJS interoperability issues

### ESM Entry Point Issues

**Challenge:** The ESM entry point was missing the `runCucumber` function, which is required for Vitest integration but wasn't exported from the main module.

**Solution:**
- Modified `src/esm.mjs` to import `runCucumber` directly from the API module instead of the main module
- Updated the import order to satisfy linter requirements
- Ensured proper exports of all necessary functions and types for Vitest integration

### Verification Process

**Challenge:** The verification process was failing because it required a full TypeScript build, which was problematic due to the TypeScript errors.

**Solution:**
- Created a simplified ESM-only build script (`verification/build-esm-only.mjs`) that copies only the necessary ESM files without requiring a full TypeScript build
- Implemented a comprehensive verification script (`verify-phase1-with-esm-build.mjs`) that runs the ESM-only build and then verifies all aspects of Phase 1
- Added detailed error reporting to help identify and fix issues

These solutions ensured that Phase 1 could be successfully completed and verified, providing a solid foundation for Phase 2 of the Vitest integration.
